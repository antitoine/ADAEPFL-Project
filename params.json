We are going to focus on visualization of the different data throughout the years.\r\n\r\nWe should focus our study on multiple points:\r\n  - General overview of the running in Switzerland\r\n  - The demographic (may be a competition between Swiss people and strangers) \r\n  - Analysis of results (may be follow some people throws the years)\r\n  - Analysis focused on teams (maybe, the performance change if people compete alone or in team)\r\n  - Measure the effect of the relief and how people can react to it (oxygen missing, etc.) (maybe Map Visualization) \r\n  - Focus on the running through the years ([youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo](https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo))\r\n\r\n## Timeplan\r\n\r\nWe plan to schedule our project on the following big steps:\r\n  - Gather data and wrangling (2 month)\r\n  - Key point study  (1 month)\r\n  - Visualization / Website  (2 month)\r\n\r\nSee below a quick overview of the project time plan:\r\n![Gantt Time Plan](Waiting upload)\r\n",
