      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <p>
        The objectives are to understand how athlete performances evolve over time for different age and gender categories as well as how external factors (e.g., weather, location, etc.) influence athletic performances.
      </p>

      <h2>Data description</h2>

      <p>
        This project will use data from the <a href="https://www.datasport.com/en/">www.datasport.com</a> website, containing sport performance of athletes over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The website contains some data of running race from the entire Switzerland.
        Moreover the website contains data throughout the year, it’s going to be useful for studying the evolution of sport in our society and specially the running whose grows exponentially the last decade.
      </p>

      <h2>Feasibility and risks</h2>

      <h3>Feasibility</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Gather the data by screen scraping the website (see homework 2)</li>
        <li>Use visualization tools to show the evolution of sport in our society throughout years (see homework 3)</li>
        <li>Statistic study of differents effects on the performance (the relief, the weather, the season of the years)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Difficulties</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Differents format of the data</li>
        <li>Size of data</li>
        <li>The language of the data (some data are in German, some other in French…)</li>
        <li>Get the weather of the running session</li>
        <li>Building visualisation (with unknown tools)</li>
        <li>Interpret correctly the results and build reliable statistics</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Deliverables</h2>

      <p>
        The deliverable is going to be a website exposing our result. We are going to focus on visualization of the different data throughout the years.
      </p>

      <p>
        We should focus our study on multiple points:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>General overview of the running in Switzerland</li>
        <li>The demographic (maybe a competition between Swiss people and strangers)</li>
        <li>Analysis of results (maybe follow some people throws the years)</li>
        <li>Analysis focused on teams (see the effect on the performance if people compete alone or in team)</li>
        <li>Measure the effect of the relief and how people can react to it (oxygen missing, etc.) (maybe Map Visualization)</li>
        <li>Focus on the running through the years (<a href="https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo">Hans Rosling's 200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes - The Joy of Stats - BBC Four</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Timeplan</h2>

      <p>
        We plan to schedule our project on the following big steps:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Gathering data and wrangling (2 month)</li>
        <li>Key point study  (1 month)</li>
        <li>Visualization / Website  (2 month)</li>
      </ul>
