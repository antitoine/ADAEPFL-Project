      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <div class="row row-lg-align-center">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>
            This project aims to focus on Lausanne Marathon and, more precisely, on the analysis of the different runs (10km, semi-marathon and marathon).
            To do so, we plan to manipulate available data, from 1999 to 2016, and use different information stored about the runners and provided by <a href="https://www.datasport.com/en/" title="DataSport Website">DataSport</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>First part: analysis of Lausanne Marathon of 2016</h3>

          <p>
            In the present part, we will study performance of runners according to different parameters, like the sex or the age. We also plan to analyze the behavior of runners in different contexts (speed following the type of running, speed of male and female runners, ...) and see if we can find some statistical differences or some patterns.
          </p>

          <h3>Second part: analysis over the years (1999-2016)</h3>

          <p>
            This part of the study will focus on all runnings of Lausanne Marathon, between 1999 and 2016.
            Among the analysis we plan to do, there will be a presentation of the evolution of the performance following the years. We will also verify if being in group ensure better score/time or not, and possibly, we'll check if, for identified groups, we can identify an improvement of performance over the years.
            We also plan to conduct basic analysis as in the first part.
            Finally, and if possible, we'll check the influence of the weather.

      <h3>Third part: analysis of some runners</h3>

      <p>
        In the third and last part, we will select sufficient number of runners to conduct statistical analysis, like the evolution of individual performance (type of running chosen, average speed, etc.).

      <h2>Data description</h2>

      <div class="thumbnail thumbnail-small">
        <img src="./assets/images/datasport-logo.jpg" alt="DataSport Logo"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        This project will use data from the <a href="https://www.datasport.com/en/">www.datasport.com</a> website, containing sport performance of athletes over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The website contains some data of running race from the entire Switzerland.
        Moreover the website contains data throughout the year, itâ€™s going to be useful for studying the evolution of sport in our society and specially the running whose grows exponentially the last decade.
      </p>

      <h2>How to use visualisations</h2>

      <p>At some point in all the website, we have make some dynamic charts that you can custom to see what you want. See below for some tips:</p>

        <div class="caption">
          <ol>
            <li>Select one value in every field regarding what you want to see, and wait few seconds that the graph is ready</li>
            <li>This two options allow to display a comparison of all lines or to just information about the point when you make an hover with the mouse</li>
            <li>Make an auto scale or reset it to the default one</li>
            <li>Zoom, move, zoom in, zoom out in the graph with your mouse</li>
            <li>Select which values to display by click on it to enable/disable</li>
            <li>Interact with the graph to get more information</li>
          </ol>
